<h1>Tshepiso, Graphic Designer</h1>
<h4>I feel, I connect, I tell Stories<h4>

<p>As an artist, design is a way of capturing energy. The kind that lives in the streets, in music, in dreams, in bold ideas</p>
<br>
<p>I’m inspired by young South African entrepreneurs and creatives who continue to push boundaries. The ones who hustle hard, and show up fully
  as themselves. Dreamers and the hopeful. I enjoy creating from ideas and visions.

I love working on projects that have purpose. Whether it’s a start-up brand, a community event, or a personal 
  hustle. I’m here for work that moves and ignites. The connection, the strive, the ambition, the joy. That’s what I design for.
I design for passion</p>

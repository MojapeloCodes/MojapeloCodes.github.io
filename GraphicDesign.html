<h1>Tshepiso, Graphic Designer</h1>
<p>I feel, I connect, I tell Stories</p>

<p>As an artist, design is a way of capturing energy. The kind that lives in the streets, in music, in dreams and in bold ideas</p>

  <p>I’m inspired by young South African entrepreneurs and creatives who continue to push boundaries. 
  I love working on projects that drive purpose. Whether it’s a start-up brand, a community event, or a personal 
  hustle. I’m here for work that moves and ignites. The connection, the strive, the ambition, the joy. That’s who I design for.

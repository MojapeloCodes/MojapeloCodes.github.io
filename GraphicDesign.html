<p>As an artist, design is a way of capturing energy. The kind that lives in the streets, in music, in dreams, in bold ideas</p>
<br>
<p>I’m inspired by young South African entrepreneurs and creatives who continue to push boundaries. 
  
<p>I love working on projects that drive purpose. Whether it’s a start-up brand, a community event, or a personal 
  hustle. I’m here for work that moves and ignites. The connection, the strive, the ambition, the joy. That’s who I design for.
</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
  <p>I am passionate about the kasi economy. I love working with start-ups and young entrepreneurs who are building from the ground up or 
    opting for a second stream of income.

   <p> <li>I enjoy designing posters for events and experiences. This could be a paint-and-sip event or a hackathon or tutoring class </li> 
    <li>I adore capturing celebratory moments by creating mementos as wedding, graduation or birthday invitations </li>
<li></li> also love working on community initiatives. Moments that bring people together, support growth, or celebrate culture and the arts </li?

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Tshepiso Mojapelo — a passionate Helpdesk Technician, Software Development graduate, and Graphic Design enthusiast <br>
      with a love for problem-solving, learning, and all things tech. With hands-on experience in managing support tickets, creating <br>
      digital solutions, and designing impactful visuals, I thrive at the intersection of people, technology, and creativity.</p>

      <p>I’ve supported complex systems Zendesk, ensuring users receive reliable, timely help. My background in software development has <br>
      sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, while my interest in user-centered design keeps me focused on crafting meaningful digital experiences.</p>

<p>Whether I’m helping someone solve a technical issue, building a website, or designing a visual story, I bring empathy, curiosity, and a drive to make a difference. <br>
  I believe in continuous growth — and I’m always learning, exploring, and pushing boundaries. </p>

<p> </p>Let’s build, fix, and reimagine the future — together.</p>

      with a love for problem-solving, learning, and all things tech. With hands-on experience in managing support tickets using a customer-centric approach. 
      I have designed impactful visuals as a freelance graphic designer. I thrive at the intersection of people, technology, and creativity.</p>

      <p>I’ve used Zendesk as a helpdesk ticketing Systems, ensuring users receive reliable, timely help, and expectations are managed as tickets are solved within SLAs.
        My background in software development has 
      sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, while my interest in user-centered design keeps me focused on crafting meaningful 
        digital experiences.</p>

<p>Whether I’m helping someone solve a technical issue, building a website, or designing a visual story, I bring empathy, curiosity, and a drive to make a difference. 
  I believe in continuous growth — and I’m always learning, exploring, and pushing boundaries. </p>
